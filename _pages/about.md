##### About

I am an undergraduate student in University of Alberta. I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I spend time doing competitive programming and design practical algorithms to solve problems. I am interested in pursuing SWE and Game Development internships.

##### Competitive Programming

I enjoy doing Competitive Programming. I've been participating in International Collegiate Programming Contest and some other local contests in Alberta.

These are some of the contests that I've participated in.

- May 2023: ICPC North America Championships 2023, placed 45th.
- Mar 2023: University of Alberta Programming Contest 2023, placed 2nd.
- Feb 2023: ICPC Rocky Mountain Regional Contest 2023, placed 6th.
- Nov 2022: Alberta Collegiate Programming Contest 2022, placed 6th.
